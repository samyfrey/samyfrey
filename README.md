### Hi there 👋🏻

I am Samy Frey, a French-American web developer based in New York City. 

Through almost 10 years of experience in investment & corporate banking, I have grown a passion for solving problems and getting complex projects across the finish line which I love applying to software engineering. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my projects!

🌎 Fun fact: I have lived in 5 cities on 4 different continents and speak 3 languages 😄
